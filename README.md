### Few-shot classification in Named Entity Recognition Task
-------------------------------------------------

This is the code accompanying the paper ["Few-shot classification in Named Entity Recognition Task"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06158) by Alexander Fritzler, Varvara Logacheva and Maksim Kretov.

Please make sure you read the paper before you try to use or analyse this code.
This repository contains 4 folders that allow you to run a specific model using Allennlp (v0.6.0) framework.

1) simple_base

This is a model that trains on a small dataset from scratch.

2) warming

This model trains on big dataset that doesn't contain objects from the validation class.

3) warm_base

This model loads from initialization generated by the previous warming model and trains as "simple_base" model.

4) warm_protonet

This model loads from initialization generated by the warming model and trains by a procedure described in the paper

To launch the model run from the corresponding folder:
```
python global_experiment.py
```

### Salman's Notes

- The config files look similar to the one in AllenNLP here:
